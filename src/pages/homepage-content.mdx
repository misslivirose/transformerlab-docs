# What is Transformer Lab?

Transformer Lab allows anyone to build, tune, & run Large Language Models locally. Beyond just talking to models, Transformer Lab allows users to train, fine-tune, preference-tune, RAG, and eval models in an easy-to-use application.

We imagine a world where every software developer will incorporate large language models in their products. Transformer Lab allows users to do this without needing to know Python nor have previous experience with machine learning.
